This project is for a mock recomendation report I had to do for an English class
The basic priciple is that I compare the runtimes of different search algorithms on a database of 1 million DNA sequences, each 4 nucleotides long
I compare Linear Search, Binary Search, and Binary Search on a pre-sorted database


the main class is in Comparison.java

sample output

Binary Search
Binary Search run time: 1156281239 ns

Sorted Binary Search
Sorted Binary Search run time: 13895 ns

Linear Search
Linear Search run time: 189822275 ns
